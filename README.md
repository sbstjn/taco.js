# Taco.js

Taco.js is a prototype and proof-of-cencept for an alternative to current like, tweet and general feedback buttons. Instead of using clicks for spreading love, you have to focus and pay attention to an element. Move on from a mindless monkey-like behaviour to showing real respect for online dedication.

Taco.js is an Express.js middleware for rating articles, giving kudos or spreading love. Ditch your old Facebook like buttons and start feeding tacos to your pagesâ€¦

Your data is yours to keep! Taco.js stores all information in your personal MongoDB. Query your logs, analyze saved metrics and generate your own reports based on the tacos fed to your pages.
